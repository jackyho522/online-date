# Year 3 project

This project aims to develop an online dating system with some security measures. Users are allowed to register and login the system. They can view other usersâ€™ profile and send private message to other users. Pfsense firewall is implemented to prevent attacks, such as DDOS and bots etc. 

PS: the message cannot be sent instantly. 
It is fully upgraded in the next project (by learning how to use web socket)
